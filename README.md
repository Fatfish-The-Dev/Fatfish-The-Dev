# Purpose of this new Github account?

Hi folks! 
I am a Backend Dev currently engaged in a more than year long process to transition to a ML Engineer
As part of that effort I wanted to document my journey ( and what better way to do it than with some projects - some public most private )
Feel free to use these projects as you see fit 
I hope you find them helpful as most of them will fit under the category of self-improvement

## Projects

- Project 1: Automated-Instragram-Poster
Even though I've had an Instagram account, I've never posted anything ( mainly to preserve my privacy ) 
But before 2024 began, I had set some clear goals for myself ( i.e. weight loss )
Figured it would help if I used posting daily on instagram as a way of keeping myself accountable on this journey
Nearly committed to doing so but chickened out at the end
But then I started my ML transition journey and figured this might be a great way to refamiliarize myself with python ( use java at work )
I'll be using it myself everday to post how I'm doing on my 2024 goals to indeed keep myself accountable
But feel free to repurpose it to however you see fit
